# real-time-web-project

This repo will hold the project you're going to build during the last two weeks of RTW. It functions as a way to show you've attained the following learning goals of this course:

* Build a Node Web App which consumes an external data source through an API and serves a frontend using routing and templating techniques.
* Create a "live" web app which reflects changes to the back-end data model in reactive front-end views, using real-time, event-based, messaging technologies like sockets or server-sent-events.
* Describe their work in a professional readme with insightful diagrams showing the life cycle of their data.

<!-- ☝️ replace this description -->

<!-- Add a nice image here at the end of the week, showing off your shiny frontend 📸 -->

<!-- Maybe a table of contents here? 📚 -->

<!-- How about a section that describes how to install this project? 🤓 -->

<!-- ...but how does one use this project? What are its features 🤔 -->

<!-- What external data source is featured in your project and what are its properties 🌠 -->

<!-- Where do the 0️⃣s and 1️⃣s live in your project? What db system are you using?-->

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ✅ -->

<!-- How about a license here? 📜 (or is it a licence?) 🤷 -->

# Concept
I'm using the Twitter API and the thing i want to do with it is that i'm searching tweets on GEO locations.
At the same time i'm tracking tweets in diffrent languages so you can see wich nationalities are on that particular locations.
So for example, i'm typing amsterdam as my location, at that point i can see how many nationalities are tweeting in Amsterdam.
